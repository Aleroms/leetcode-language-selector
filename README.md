# Leetcode Language Selector

I wanted to get better at languages I got rusty and thought "what if I create a web app that randomly selects that day's leetcode challenge's language?" and so I did.

Leetcode Language Selector selects which language to use that day. Provide it the languages you want to cycle in your rotation, as well with some options and now you can get back to what's important - grinding leetcode challenges.
